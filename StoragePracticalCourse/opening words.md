> **Almost all technical problems that are particularly difficult to solve, cost you a lot, or cause heavy losses can be classified as storage system problems.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a quote from the book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann. It is a great book and I highly recommend it. It is a book about databases and storage systems, and it is a great resource for understanding the principles of storage systems.

We have to say that storage systems are the most important part of any system.
